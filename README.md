# End-to-End-NLP-Web-Application

Here I am creating another NLP project which is going to be an end to end project.

I am going to perform Text Summarization.

They are two types of Data Summarization:
- **Extractiv** (Easy to achieve, Less CPU Consumption, NLTK Library)
- **Abstractive** (Difficult to achieve, More CPU Consumption, Transformers & Pipelines)

I am going to apply **Hugging Face**. 

Hugging Face: Build, train and deploy state of the art models powered by thr reference open-source in natural language processing.
